# ProcessWire Auto-Generated API

These are [ApiGen](http://www.apigen.org/) PHP Documentation for the CMF/CMS [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). 

## Important
Please note that these are **technical documentation** not aimed at the *average* ProcessWire user but developers who are curious or need to find out in more detail about a specific ProcessWire class or function and/or use this as a reference. Most of the technical stuff here steps outside ProcessWire's public API into the inner workings of the CMF/CMS. If you would like to know more about such stuff, then this is for you. For all other uses, please use the regular [ProcessWire API docs](http://processwire.com/api/) and the ProcessWire [Cheatsheet](http://cheatsheet.processwire.com/). Please also be aware that since the ProcessWire core is regularly [updated](https://github.com/processwire/processwire/commits/dev), **methods and properties may be subject to change in later versions**. So what you find documented here today, may not be here tomorrow. 

## About
The documentation covers **all .php and .modules files under the '/wire/core/' and 'wire/modules'/ folders**. All the current active ProcessWire 3 branches, [master](https://github.com/processwire/processwire/) and [dev](https://github.com/processwire/processwire/tree/dev) as well as [ProcessWire 2.8 master](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-legacy/) and the older ProcessWire 2.7 branches [master](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessWire/) and [dev](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessWire/tree/dev) are separately documented. **Only the ProcessWire 3 and 2.8 branches' documentation** are *auto-generated* at regular intervals. However, although the older 2.7 is no longer actively maintained, it is still in much active use in the wild and so is documented here.


## Update Cycles
Currently, the update schedule for these documentation is:

* ProcessWire 3 master branch: once at the beginning of **every month**
* ProcessWire 3 dev branch: weekly, **every Friday**
* ProcessWire 2.8 master branch: once at the beginning of **every month**

The above mean that unless otherwise stated, these docs should roughly be in step with the latests versions of ProcessWire.


The individual project files are located in sub-folders named according to their branch. Please note that GitHub will truncate a file list when it goes beyond 1000. If looking for a particular file, just search for it.


The documentation is generated using an older version of [ApiGen](https://github.com/ApiGen/ApiGen/), so there ~~could~~ will be bugs. Please report any bugs by filing an [issue](https://github.com/kongondo/ProcessWireAPIGen/issues), thanks.


Please note that since these docs are auto-generated and auto-uploaded to GitHub, there might be the occasional hiccup. Please let me know if you come across any wonkiness :-).

* ProcessWire 2.7 Dev Branch API [docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/pw27dev/)


## Other stuff

The theme used in the documentation is 'sublime text', a custom theme I hacked together based on the default ApiGen theme. By default the documentation will be displayed using the default ApiGen theme. If you prefer a darker theme, select it in the theme switcher.


## Known Bugs

* Some pages generated with extra **...** just before the HTML suffix, resulting in 404s. Upgrading to a newer version of ApiGen will probably fix this. In the meantime, delete the extra *...* in the URL and you are good to go.
