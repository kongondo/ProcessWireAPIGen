# ProcessWire Auto-Generated API

These are [ApiGen](http://www.apigen.org/) PHP Documentation for the CMF/CMS [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). 

## Important
Please note that these are **technical documentation** not aimed at the *average* ProcessWire user but developers who are curious or need to find out in more detail about a specific ProcessWire class or function and/or use this as a reference. Most of the technical stuff here steps outside ProcessWire's public API into the inner workings of the CMF/CMS. If you would like to know more about such stuff, then this is for you. For all other use, please use the regular [ProcessWire API docs](http://processwire.com/api/) and the ProcessWire [Cheatsheet](http://cheatsheet.processwire.com/). Please also be aware that since the ProcessWire core is regularly [updated](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessWire/commits/dev), **methods and properties may be subject to change in later versions**. So what you find documented here today, may not be here tomorrow :-). 

## About
The documentation covers everything under the **'/wire/' folder, both .php and .module files**. All the current active ProcessWire branches, [master](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessWire), [dev](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessWire/tree/dev), [devns](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessWire/tree/devns) are separately documented. Each branch's documentation is *auto-generated* at regular intervals. 


## Update Cycles
Currently, the update schedule for these documentation is:

* master branch: once at the beginning of **every month**
* dev branch: weekly, **every Monday**
* devns branch: weekly, **every Tuesday**

The above mean that unless otherwise stated, these docs should roughly be in step with the latests versions of ProcessWire.


The individual project files are located in sub-folders named according to their branch. Please note that GitHub will truncate a file list when it goes beyond 1000. If looking for a particular file, just search for it.


The documentation is generated using an older version of [ApiGen](https://github.com/ApiGen/ApiGen/), so there ~~could~~ will be bugs. I will update to the latest version of the document generator in the near future. Please report any bugs by filing an [issue](https://github.com/kongondo/ProcessWireAPIGen/issues), thanks.


Please note that since these docs are auto-generated and auto-uploaded to GitHub, there might be the occasional hiccup. Please let me know if you come across any wonkiness :-).


### ProcessWire API Documentation

* Master Branch API [docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/master/)
* Dev Branch API [docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/dev/)
* Dev Namespace Branch API [docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/devns/)


### Other stuff

The current theme used in the docs is 'sublime text', a custom theme I hacked together based on the default ApiGen theme. I am working on a theme switcher for those who'd prefer a lighter variant.


### Known Bugs

* Some pages generated with extra *...* just before the HTML suffix, resulting in 404s. Upgrading to a newer version of ApiGen will probably fix this. In the meantime, delete the extra *...* in the URL and you are good to go.
