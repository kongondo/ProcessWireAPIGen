# ProcessWire Auto-Generated API

These are [ApiGen](http://www.apigen.org/) PHP Documentation for the CMS [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). 


The documentation covers everything under the **'/wire/' folder, both .php and .module files**. All the current active ProcessWire branches listed below are separately documented. Each branch's documentation is auto-generated at regular intervals. Currently, the master branch, once at the beginning of every month, the dev and devns branches weekly, every Friday. 


The individual project files are located in sub-folders named according to their branch. Please note that GitHub will truncate a file list when it goes beyond 1000. If looking for a particular file, just search for it.


The documentation is generated using an older version of [ApiGen](https://github.com/ApiGen/ApiGen/), so there ~~could~~ will be bugs. I will update to the latest version of the document generator in the near future. Please report any bugs by filing an [issue](https://github.com/kongondo/ProcessWireAPIGen/issues), thanks.


Please note that since these docs are auto-generated and auto-uploaded to GitHub, there might be the occasional hiccup. Please also let me know if you come across any wonkiness :-).


### ProcessWire API Documentation

* Master Branch API [Docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/master/)
* Dev Branch API [Docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/dev/)
* Dev Namespace Branch API [Docs](http://kongondo.github.io/ProcessWireAPIGen/devns/)


### Other stuff

The current theme used in the docs is 'sublime text', a custom theme I hacked together based on the default ApiGen theme.


### Known Bugs

* Some pages generated with extra *...* just before the HTML suffix, resulting in 404s. Upgrading to a newer version of ApiGen will probably fix this. In the meantime, delete the extra *...* in the URL and you are good to go.
